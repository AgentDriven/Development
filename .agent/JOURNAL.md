# AgentDriven Development Journal

## Session 1: Initial Setup

**Date**: March 11, 2025

### Key Discussions

- Created GitHub organization: [AgentDriven](https://github.com/AgentDriven)
- Decided on MIT License for all repositories
- Established semantic versioning approach for development phases
- Created initial `.cursorrules` file with ADD protocol
- Developed README.md to explain the methodology

### Decisions Made

- Simplified branch strategy from original concept
- Implemented version-based phase tracking instead of branch-based
- Defined 10 development phases with corresponding version ranges
- Chose to use tags for tracking progress rather than long-lived branches
- Established clear phase transition criteria

### Challenges Addressed

- Original branching strategy was deemed too complex and difficult to manage
- Merging and rebasing across multiple long-lived branches would be tedious
- Needed a more streamlined approach while maintaining structured development

### Next Actions

- Complete initial repository setup
- Create MIT LICENSE file
- Create template repositories for different project types
- Document phase transition criteria in detail
- Establish standard project structure templates

## Session 2: Project Reorganization

**Date**: March 11, 2025

### Key Actions

- Created `.agent` directory to organize configuration files
- Moved configuration files into the `.agent` directory:
  - `.cursorrules`
  - `PROJECT.md`
  - `PHASES.md`
  - `JOURNAL.md`
- Created `.agent/plans` directory for planning documents
- Added `roadmap.md` with short, mid, and long-term goals
- Updated references in documentation to reflect new file locations
- Added project structure documentation to README.md

### Decisions Made

- Chose `.agent` over `.cursor` for the configuration directory to better align with the AgentDriven methodology
- Maintained core files (LICENSE, README.md, .gitignore, .editorconfig) in the root directory
- Organized all AI and methodology-specific files in the `.agent` directory

### Next Actions

- Complete remaining Config phase tasks
- Create initial template repositories
- Develop basic tooling support for the methodology
- Begin planning for Project phase (v0.1.x)

## Future Sessions Planning

- Define standard templates for different project types
- Create documentation for onboarding new developers to the methodology
- Develop tooling to support the ADD workflow
- Establish metrics for measuring development progress
