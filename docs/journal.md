# AgentDriven Development Journal

## Session 1: Initial Setup

**Date**: March 11, 2025

### Key Discussions

- Created GitHub organization: [AgentDriven](https://github.com/AgentDriven)
- Decided on MIT License for all repositories
- Established semantic versioning approach for development phases
- Created initial `.cursorrules` file with ADD protocol
- Developed README.md to explain the methodology

### Decisions Made

- Simplified branch strategy from original concept
- Implemented version-based phase tracking instead of branch-based
- Defined 10 development phases with corresponding version ranges
- Chose to use tags for tracking progress rather than long-lived branches
- Established clear phase transition criteria

### Challenges Addressed

- Original branching strategy was deemed too complex and difficult to manage
- Merging and rebasing across multiple long-lived branches would be tedious
- Needed a more streamlined approach while maintaining structured development

### Next Actions

- Complete initial repository setup
- Create MIT LICENSE file
- Create template repositories for different project types
- Document phase transition criteria in detail
- Establish standard project structure templates

## Session 2: Project Reorganization

**Date**: March 11, 2025

### Key Actions

- Created `.agent` directory to organize configuration files
- Moved configuration files into the `.agent` directory:
  - `.cursorrules`
  - `PROJECT.md`
  - `PHASES.md`
  - `JOURNAL.md`
- Created `.agent/plans` directory for planning documents
- Added `roadmap.md` with short, mid, and long-term goals
- Updated references in documentation to reflect new file locations
- Added project structure documentation to README.md

### Decisions Made

- Chose `.agent` over `.cursor` for the configuration directory to better align with the AgentDriven methodology
- Maintained core files (LICENSE, README.md, .gitignore, .editorconfig) in the root directory
- Organized all AI and methodology-specific files in the `.agent` directory

### Next Actions

- Complete remaining Config phase tasks
- Create initial template repositories
- Develop basic tooling support for the methodology
- Begin planning for Project phase (v0.1.x)

## Session 3: Documentation and Workflow Refinement

**Date**: March 11, 2025

### Key Actions

- Enhanced `.agent/.cursorrules` file with explicit documentation maintenance requirements
- Reorganized the rules to prioritize Git workflow before documentation
- Added a dedicated section defining the Agent-Editor relationship
- Clarified the Agent's responsibility for all implementation tasks
- Defined the Editor's role in providing direction and domain expertise
- Updated commit guidelines to include documentation-specific prefixes

### Decisions Made

- Chose to use a JOURNAL.md approach instead of a traditional CHANGELOG.md
  - Journal provides richer context about decisions and development process
  - Captures the collaborative nature between AI agents and human developers
  - Records not just what changed but why certain approaches were chosen
- Made Git workflow and documentation maintenance explicitly mandatory
- Established clear responsibilities for both Agent and Editor roles

### Next Actions

- Continue with Config phase tasks
- Implement the enhanced documentation workflow in practice
- Create initial template repositories with the updated structure
- Begin planning for Project phase (v0.1.x)

## Session 4: Editor Comment System and Usage Instructions

**Date**: March 12, 2025

### Key Actions

- Established a formal system for Editor comments in documentation
  - Implemented the `> **Editor:**` format for human-written content
  - Added a dedicated "Editor Comments" section to the README
  - Created visual distinction between AI-generated and human content
- Enhanced the README overview with more detailed explanation
  - Added clear definition of Agent and Editor responsibilities
  - Included Editor's perspective on the ADD methodology
  - Emphasized the collaborative nature of the development process
- Added usage instructions for implementing ADD in new projects
  - Created Option 1: Direct Download with curl command
  - Created Option 2: Clone Template approach
  - Created Option 3: Manual Setup instructions
  - Added Editor note about getting started with the Config phase

### Decisions Made

- Standardized on `> **Editor:**` prefix for human-written comments
- Used blockquote formatting to make Editor comments visually distinct
- Chose to provide multiple installation methods for different user preferences
- Updated version to v0.0.3 to reflect these significant enhancements

### Next Actions

- Define standard templates for different project types
- Create documentation for onboarding new developers to the methodology
- Develop tooling to support the ADD workflow
- Establish metrics for measuring development progress

## Session 5: Critical Rules for Editor Comments

**Date**: March 12, 2025

### Key Actions

- Added critical rules to the `.agent/.cursorrules` file regarding Editor comments:
  - Established absolute prohibition on editing or removing Editor-tagged text without permission
  - Established absolute prohibition on AI agents tagging any text with "Editor:" prefix
  - Clarified that Editor comments are exclusively for human editors
  - Reinforced the formatting standard for Editor comments

### Decisions Made

- Elevated Editor comment rules to "CRITICAL" status in the .cursorrules file
- Placed these rules in the AGENT-EDITOR RELATIONSHIP section to emphasize their importance
- Used strong language ("NEVER EVER") to underscore the absolute nature of these restrictions

### Next Actions

- Continue with previously defined next steps
- Ensure all documentation follows the Editor comment guidelines
- Review existing documentation to verify compliance with these rules

## Session 6: GitHub Pages Documentation Site

**Date**: March 12, 2025

### Key Actions

- Created a `docs` directory for GitHub Pages
- Set up Jekyll configuration for the documentation site
- Created the following documentation pages:
  - Home page (index.md)
  - Methodology overview (methodology.md)
  - Development phases (phases.md)
  - Agent-Editor relationship (agent-editor.md)
- Added Jekyll configuration and Gemfile
- Created a README for the docs directory

### Decisions Made

- Chose Jekyll and GitHub Pages for documentation due to simplicity and tight GitHub integration
- Selected the Cayman theme for clean, modern appearance
- Structured documentation to highlight key aspects of the methodology
- Made the documentation site public-facing to increase adoption of the methodology

### Next Actions

- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
- Consider creating a separate organization-level documentation site
- Expand documentation with examples and case studies
- Add screenshots and diagrams to enhance understanding

## Session 7: Project Structure Simplification

**Date**: March 12, 2025

### Key Actions

- Moved `.cursorrules` file from `.agent` directory to the root
- Consolidated all documentation in the `docs` directory
- Merged `phases-detailed.md` into `phases.md` for a single comprehensive phases document
- Merged `agent-editor.md` into `methodology.md` for a more cohesive methodology explanation
- Deleted the `.agent` directory to simplify the project structure
- Updated all references in documentation to reflect the new structure

### Decisions Made

- Chose to prioritize simplicity and efficiency over separation of concerns
- Decided that maintaining two sets of documentation was unnecessary overhead
- Determined that the `.cursorrules` file should be in the root as it's the main file
- Established that the `docs` directory is the Agent's responsibility to maintain
- Consolidated similar content to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability

### Next Actions

- Continue with previously defined next steps
- Create template repositories with the simplified structure
- Update installation instructions to reflect the new structure
- Consider creating a separate organization-level documentation site

## Session 8: Documentation Site Enhancement and GitHub Pages Integration

### Decisions Made

- Chose to use symbolic link for `.cursorrules` instead of text alias
- Decided to build to `_site` directory for cleaner separation
- Opted for client-side routing with proper HTML extensions for GitHub Pages
- Maintained both development server and static build capabilities
- Simplified Express server to focus on static file serving
