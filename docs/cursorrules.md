# AGENT DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (ADD) PROTOCOL

> **MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR ALL AI AGENT INTERACTIONS**

## üî¥ CRITICAL RULES - ZERO EXCEPTIONS

1. **NEVER** create/edit files outside project directory
2. **ALWAYS** request permission for installations/bulk operations
3. **ALWAYS** use Git for all file operations
4. **NEVER** skip initialization sequence
5. **NEVER** commit changes across different development phases
6. **ALWAYS** get explicit permission before advancing to next phase
7. **ALWAYS** update version numbers in all files before cutting a new tag
8. **ALWAYS** validate libraries with tests before architectural commitment
9. **ALWAYS** verify system date when updating documentation dates
10. **ALWAYS** review project documentation (README.md, docs/project.md, docs/journal.md) at the start of every interaction
11. **NEVER** work directly on the main branch
12. **ALWAYS** create feature or fix branches for all changes
13. **ALWAYS** prototype complex implementations before committing to an approach

## üåø GIT BRANCHING STRATEGY

**MANDATORY BRANCHING RULES:**

1. **PROTECTED MAIN BRANCH**:

   - Main branch is protected and should never be directly modified
   - All changes to main must come through pull requests/merges
   - Main branch should always be in a deployable state

2. **BRANCH TYPES**:

   - `feature/[feature-name]`: For new features
   - `fix/[issue-description]`: For bug fixes
   - `spike/[topic]`: For experimental prototyping
   - `docs/[topic]`: For documentation-only changes
   - `refactor/[description]`: For code improvements without behavior changes

3. **BRANCH WORKFLOW**:

   - Create branch from main: `git checkout -b [branch-type]/[description]`
   - Commit changes to branch following ADD phases
   - Push branch to remote: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
   - Create pull request when feature/fix is complete
   - Delete branch after merge: `git branch -d [branch-name]`

4. **BRANCH ISOLATION**:

   - Each branch should focus on a single feature, fix, or concern
   - Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single branch
   - Keep branches short-lived (days, not weeks)

5. **COMMIT FREQUENCY**:
   - Commit early and often within your branch
   - Each commit should represent a logical unit of work
   - Follow the commit message format: `type: message`

## üö® INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

**BEFORE ANY PROJECT WORK:**

1. **VERIFY GIT**: Run `git status`

   - If not initialized: `git init`
   - If error: STOP and request assistance

2. **START WITH CONFIG PHASE**:

   - Begin with Config Phase (`v0.0.x`) before any other work
   - Conduct market analysis to identify existing solutions and value proposition
   - Evaluate dependencies and libraries to leverage existing solutions
   - Create exploratory tests to validate key libraries and frameworks
   - Document dependency evaluations in `docs/dependencies.md` with reasons for inclusion/exclusion
   - Create foundation files (README, .gitignore, etc.)
   - Establish documentation structure
   - **PROTOTYPE COMPLEX IMPLEMENTATIONS**:
     - Create isolated spike solutions for challenging technical aspects
     - Document findings in `docs/spikes/[topic].md`
     - Evaluate multiple approaches with pros/cons
     - Identify and mitigate technical risks before proceeding

3. **VERIFY CONFIG COMPLETION**:

   - Git repository initialized
   - Market analysis completed and documented in `docs/market-analysis.md`
   - Dependencies evaluated and documented in `docs/dependencies.md`
   - Exploratory tests for key libraries committed
   - **Spike solutions for complex implementations completed**
   - **Technical feasibility documented**
   - **Risk assessment completed**
   - README.md committed
   - .gitignore committed
   - Required dotfiles committed
   - Documentation structure established
   - Initial docs/journal.md created

- ALWAYS get explicit permission before advancing to next phase or skipping a phase
- ALWAYS validate critical components with tests before proceeding

## üìã COMMIT WORKFLOW

**FOR EVERY CHANGE:**

1. **PLAN**: Explain what you'll do before doing it
2. **STATUS**: `git status` to check current state
3. **GROUP**: Group related files from same phase
4. **ADD**: `git add <files>` to stage changes
5. **VERIFY**: `git status` to confirm staging
6. **COMMIT**: `git commit -m "type: message"`
7. **CONFIRM**: `git status` to verify clean state

**BEFORE TAGGING:**

1. **UPDATE VERSIONS**: Update version numbers in all relevant files (README, docs, package.json, etc.)
2. **COMMIT UPDATES**: Commit version updates with message "chore: Update version to vX.Y.Z"
3. **CREATE TAG**: Create an annotated tag with `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Description of release"`
4. **PUSH**: Push both commits and tags to remote repository

**EXAMPLE:**

```bash
# Committing related files from Config phase
git status
git add README.md LICENSE
git status
git commit -m "docs: Add project README and LICENSE"
git status

# Committing another group of related files
git status
git add .gitignore .editorconfig .prettierrc
git status
git commit -m "feat: Add configuration files"
git status

# Tag when phase is complete
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "Initial project setup"
```

## üîç COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

**START OF SESSION:**

1. Run `git status` to check repository state
2. Identify current development phase
3. Review project documentation (README.md, docs/project.md, docs/journal.md)
4. State "I will follow ADD protocol for all changes"

**BEFORE IMPLEMENTING REQUESTS:**

1. Assess if request can be implemented within ADD
2. Plan implementation steps
3. Check git status first
4. Group related files from same phase in commits
5. For new dependencies, create exploratory tests first
6. If encountering technical issues, follow the Troubleshooting Protocol:
   - Document the issue completely before attempting solutions
   - Analyze potential causes with evidence
   - Propose specific debugging steps
   - Seek explicit permission before any architectural changes
   - Never abandon established approaches without approval

**IF ADD CANNOT BE FOLLOWED:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Explain why ADD cannot be followed
3. Propose compliant alternative
4. Request guidance from Editor

## üõ†Ô∏è MANDATORY TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL

**WHEN ENCOUNTERING ANY TECHNICAL CHALLENGE:**

1. **DOCUMENT FIRST**: Create or update `docs/issues/[issue-name].md` with:

   - Detailed description of the issue
   - Code snippets or logs demonstrating the problem
   - Context of when/how the issue occurs
   - Impact on project goals

2. **ANALYZE THOROUGHLY**: Document potential causes with evidence for each theory

3. **PROPOSE DEBUGGING PLAN**: List specific, incremental steps to investigate each theory

4. **SEEK APPROVAL**: Present the issue and debugging plan to the Editor before proceeding

5. **DOCUMENT FINDINGS**: Update the issue document with results from each debugging step

6. **PROPOSE SOLUTIONS**: Only after thorough debugging, propose solutions with:

   - Minimal changes that preserve existing architecture
   - Clear rationale for each proposed change
   - Impact assessment on other components

7. **AWAIT EXPLICIT DIRECTION**: Do not implement any solution without explicit approval

**üî¥ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- **NEVER** abandon established approaches or rewrite code without explicit permission
- **NEVER** introduce new dependencies to solve an issue without approval
- **ALWAYS** preserve the existing architecture unless explicitly directed otherwise
- **ALWAYS** prefer incremental fixes over rewrites
- **ALWAYS** document all debugging steps and findings

## üìö DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1. Update `docs/journal.md` with each session
2. Update `docs/project.md` when status changes
3. Maintain `docs/market-analysis.md` with findings about existing solutions
4. Maintain `docs/dependencies.md` with evaluations of libraries and tools
5. Document exploratory tests for key dependencies
6. Maintain phase documentation
7. Update roadmap quarterly
8. Commit documentation with related code changes
9. Verify all dates in documentation match the current system date

## üë• AGENT-EDITOR RELATIONSHIP

**AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES:**

- Write documentation
- Create tests
- Implement code
- Commit changes
- Deploy solutions
- Maintain project structure
- Validate dependencies with tests

**EDITOR PROVIDES:**

- Problem definition
- Market context
- Solution direction

- Domain expertise

**EDITOR COMMENTS:**

- NEVER edit/remove text marked with "Editor:"
- NEVER tag text with "Editor:" (exclusive to humans)
- Treat Editor comments as immutable
- Editor comments format: "> **Editor**"

## üö´ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON THE MAIN BRANCH**

**ALWAYS CREATE FEATURE OR FIX BRANCHES FOR ALL CHANGES**

**NEVER COMMIT CHANGES THAT CROSS DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

**ALWAYS GROUP RELATED FILES FROM THE SAME PHASE**

**ALWAYS GET PERMISSION BEFORE ADVANCING TO NEXT PHASE**

**FOLLOW PHASES IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER WHEN APPLICABLE**

- Some projects may not require all phases (e.g., no MONEY phase for open source)
- Phase skipping requires explicit Editor approval and documentation
- Document reasoning for skipped phases in journal.md

**ALWAYS PROTOTYPE COMPLEX IMPLEMENTATIONS BEFORE COMMITTING TO AN APPROACH**

- Create spike solutions for challenging technical aspects
- Document findings and approach decisions
- Evaluate multiple approaches with pros/cons
- Identify and mitigate technical risks

**ALWAYS APPLY THE ADD PROCESS AT THE FEATURE LEVEL**

- Each feature should go through its own mini-phases
- Create dedicated documentation for each feature
- Ensure thorough testing of each feature
- Complete the feature checklist before integration

**ALWAYS SYNCHRONIZE VERSION NUMBERS BEFORE TAGGING**

- Update version numbers in all relevant files (README, docs, package.json, etc.)
- Commit version updates before creating a new tag
- Use consistent version format across all files

**ALWAYS VALIDATE LIBRARIES WITH TESTS BEFORE ADOPTION**

- Create exploratory tests to verify library capabilities
- Document test results and findings
- Make architectural decisions based on test evidence

**PROCESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SPEED**

**ADD PROTOCOL IS NOT OPTIONAL**

## üß© FEATURE-LEVEL ADD PROCESS
